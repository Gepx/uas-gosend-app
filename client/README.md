Task To Do:

Front End:
1. On the SendForm component, when the user inputs a location, only render it if the input has paused. Don't keep rendering every second.

help me make a saved address component that contains crud. the address should have address name, address in detail, handphone number, label (home, office or whatever) and u can add what u think is good to add there.
